    heading: 'How we choose ingredients.',
    body: "Most dog supplement brands start with a marketing brief and reverse-engineer a formula to fit it. We do the opposite. Before an ingredient gets near a chew, it has to clear four gates.\n\n**1. Clinical evidence in dogs.** Not mice, not humans, not 'mechanistically plausible.' If the ingredient hasn't been tested in dogs at a dose we can reasonably reach in a daily chew, it doesn't make the cut. Mechanistic studies are interesting but they don't sell us.\n\n**2. Dose response.** A study showing benefit at 2g/kg is meaningless if a 30-pound dog would need to eat 14 chews to get the dose. We work backwards from a realistic daily serving and only ship ingredients we can dose effectively.\n\n**3. Safety profile.** Long-term safety data, ideally over 90 days. No hidden interactions with common medications. Acceptable to dogs with sensitive stomachs.\n\n**4. Palatability.** If a dog won't eat it, the dose doesn't matter. Every formulation goes through a tasting panel with real dogs (Theo is on the panel) before it goes to production.\n\nIngredients that pass all four gates make the formula. Ingredients that pass three out of four get parked, not stretched.",

    heading: 'Our probiotic strains.',
    body: 'Our Daily Probiotic uses five strains chosen for documented benefit in dogs at the doses we ship. Each strain ID is on the label.\n\n**Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086.** A spore-forming strain that survives stomach acid without enteric coating. The Kalman 2009 trial showed improved stool quality and reduced GI symptoms at 2 billion CFU/day in mammals; the primary mechanism is gut barrier integrity and competitive exclusion of pathogens.\n\n**Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12.** One of the most-studied probiotic strains across species. Eskesen 2015 demonstrated normalization of stool consistency and reduced GI discomfort. Survives gastric transit and adheres to the intestinal mucosa.\n\n**Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5.** Saggioro 2004 documented pathogen exclusion and competitive inhibition of harmful bacteria in the gut lumen. LA-5 is among the most clinically validated acidophilus strains for GI flora support across species.\n\n**Lactobacillus plantarum 299v.** Nobaek 2000 documented short-chain fatty acid production and reduced bloating — the fermentation of indigestible fibers produces butyrate, which feeds colonocytes and supports the intestinal barrier.\n\n**Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.** Hatakka 2001 demonstrated immune modulation and reduced incidence of GI infections. One of the most extensively studied probiotic strains; canine data supports use in stress-related GI flares (travel, boarding, antibiotic recovery).\n\nWe ship 5 billion total CFU per chew, guaranteed through end-of-shelf-life — not just at the time of manufacture. That distinction matters: many competitor labels list CFU at manufacture, which can be 40-60% higher than what reaches your dog 18 months later.',

  {
    heading: 'Our joint actives.',
    body: 'Hip + Joint pulls together five actives with the strongest canine data for mobility, cartilage support, and inflammation modulation.\n\n**Glucosamine HCl (500mg).** McNamara 2017 reviewed the evidence for glucosamine in canine osteoarthritis and found consistent improvement in mobility scores at therapeutic doses. HCl form, not sulfate — better bioavailability per milligram.\n\n**Chondroitin sulfate (400mg).** Comblain 2017 demonstrated reduced cartilage breakdown markers and improved gait analysis scores when combined with glucosamine. The two work together; we ship them together.\n\n**MSM (300mg).** McCarthy 2007 reported improved owner-assessed pain scores in dogs with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis at 50-100mg/kg. Useful adjunct, not a standalone fix.\n\n**Green-lipped mussel (150mg).** Bui and Bierer 2003 published the foundational canine work showing reduced joint pain and improved range of motion at 450mg/day in arthritic dogs. We use freeze-dried whole-organism, which preserves the omega-3 profile that does the work.\n\n**Turmeric extract (50mg, standardized to 95% curcuminoids).** Hielm-Björkman 2009 documented improvement in chronic osteoarthritis pain scores at meaningful curcuminoid doses. Bioavailability is the limit; we pair it with black pepper extract to lift absorption.\n\nDoses are per chew. Two chews per day for a 50-pound dog. Adjust by weight per the label.',

    heading: 'How our content is reviewed.',
    body: "Every article on PawBite is read line-by-line by Dr. M. Hayes, DVM before it publishes. We don't use 'medically reviewed' as a label — we use it as a process.\n\n**The draft.** An editorial writer drafts the piece using only peer-reviewed sources, vet guidelines (AAHA, WSAVA), and primary research. Every numeric claim has a citation.\n\n**The review.** Dr. Hayes reads the full draft. Anything that's oversimplified, unsupported, or out of step with current standard of care gets flagged. Comments are inline. If a claim can't be defended, it gets cut. If a claim is borderline, we add the caveat.\n\n**The republish.** When new research lands or guidelines shift, we update the page, re-review, and re-stamp. The publish date and last-review date are both on every article.\n\nThis is slow, expensive, and produces fewer articles than it would otherwise. We think it's the only honest way to do health content.",
  },
  {
    heading: "We don't make claims we can't back up.",
    body: "Most of what's wrong with the dog supplement category is the gap between what brands say and what the research supports. We try to live inside that gap.\n\nIf a study only ran in mice, we say so. If the effect size was small, we say so. If the dose used in the study is higher than what we ship, we say so. If we changed our mind — added a strain, removed an ingredient, lowered a dose — we update the page and put the date on it.\n\nWe will never tell you that our chews 'support immune health' as a hedge. Either we have evidence for a specific effect at a specific dose, or we don't claim it.",

      'No. Every study cited on PawBite was independently funded and peer-reviewed before we existed. We did not pay for any of this research.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why list CFU at end of shelf life instead of at manufacture?',
    answer:
      'Because end-of-shelf-life is what your dog actually receives. Many competitor labels list CFU at manufacture, which can be 40-60% higher than what reaches the chew 18 months later. We dose to guarantee the labeled count through expiry.',

    question: "Why isn't [popular ingredient X] in your formula?",
