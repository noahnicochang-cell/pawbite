- All 50 US states (including Alaska and Hawaii)
- US military APO/FPO addresses
- US territories: Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands

Not yet shipping to: Canada (on the roadmap), the EU, the UK, or anywhere else international. We'll add international when we can do it without compromising delivery times.`,

**One-time orders over $40:** Free.

**One-time orders under $40:** $5 flat shipping.

**Expedited shipping:** Not currently offered. We're a small operation and standard shipping gets your dog's chews to you in less than a week — which is fine since you're not running out today.`,

**Transit time:**
- East Coast: 2-4 business days
- Midwest: 3-5 business days
- West Coast / Mountain: 4-7 business days
- Alaska / Hawaii: 5-10 business days

**Carriers:** We use a mix of UPS Ground, USPS Priority, and DHL — whichever has the best route to your address. You'll get a tracking number via email when your order ships.`,

We ship your next order based on when the prior order shipped — not when it was delivered. So if your dog finishes the chews a few days before the next order arrives, you can skip the next shipment or move it up.

Skip, pause, swap, or cancel from your account in one click. No emails. No phone calls.`,

If the canister arrives crushed, leaking, or open, send us a photo at help@pawbite.com and we'll ship a replacement. Don't feed your dog any chews from a damaged canister.

If your package is sent to the wrong address because you typed it wrong, we can still help. We'll redirect the original (if possible) or send a replacement at cost.`,
