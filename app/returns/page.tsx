You don't need to ship the chews back. We don't ask follow-up questions. We don't make you fill out forms. Just email us with your order number and we'll process the refund within 5 business days.

Why are we so easy about this? Because if a dog doesn't respond well to a supplement, the right move is to figure out what does work — not to make the owner feel stuck. And honestly, very few people use the guarantee. Most dogs respond to one or both of our products.`,

**Damaged on arrival:** Send a photo within 14 days, we'll ship a replacement at no charge.

**Sudden adverse reaction:** Stop the chew, contact your vet, then email us. We'll refund the affected order and pause your subscription so you can decide whether to swap SKUs or cancel.

**Allergic reaction discovered later:** If you've been on PawBite for months and discover your dog has developed a chicken sensitivity (we use chicken in Daily Probiotic and duck in Hip + Joint, so swapping flavors usually helps), email us and we'll work it out.

**Wrong product shipped:** Our fault — we ship the right thing at no charge and you can keep the wrong one.`,

**Damage caused by leaving the package outside.** If tracking shows delivered and the canister was rained on while it sat on your porch for three days, that's not on us. Bring it in.

**Returns more than 14 days after delivery, unless covered by the 90-day guarantee.** After 14 days, the assumption is the product is fine and we've already invoiced you. The 90-day guarantee is the catch for "I tried it and it didn't work" — the 14-day window is for "it arrived broken."`,

If you cancel and want to come back later, your account stays — log in with the same email and reactivate.

If you want to pause for a bit instead of cancelling, you can do that too. Pause indefinitely, or set a return date.`,

If you paid with a gift card, store credit, or promo code, the refund returns to those original sources first, then any remainder to your card.

You'll get an email confirmation when the refund is processed.`,
