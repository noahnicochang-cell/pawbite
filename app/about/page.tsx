                <p>
                  Noah Chang grew up with dogs. First, a scrappy mutt named Paw. Then, when he was 12, came Cam Sonic — a white boxer who taught him what it meant to actually pay attention to a dog's health, day in and day out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Years later, in a small Manhattan apartment on 30th and 1st, Noah was one of the top-rated dog walkers on Rover and Wag — sitting for friends' dogs, family dogs, and during COVID lockdown, his boss's dog, Lola.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Six months alone with Lola changed everything. With nothing else to do, Noah started cooking. Human-grade meat. Human-grade vegetables. Human-grade probiotics, mixed into her meals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within weeks, Lola's energy came back. Her stool went from inconsistent and unpredictable to clockwork. The change was so obvious it stopped being subtle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That was the moment PawBite started. Not in a lab. Not in a pitch deck. In a kitchen on 30th and 1st, with a borrowed dog, during a pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  PawBite is the probiotic Noah wishes he'd had for Lola from day one. Real research. Real strains. Daily support for dogs that deserve human-grade care.

                <p>
                  Most dog supplement brands sell twenty or thirty SKUs. Skin chew, calming chew,
                  allergy chew, anxiety chew, multivitamin chew, dental chew, eye chew. Half of them
                  are the same base recipe with a different sticker.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We make two: a daily probiotic and a hip + joint chew. That&apos;s what most dogs
                  actually need, and it&apos;s what we can stand behind without bending the
                  evidence. Every dollar we don&apos;t spend launching a fourteenth flavor of
                  calming chew goes into better strains, higher doses, and slower, more careful
                  formulation. Two products means we know every ingredient, every supplier, and
                  every batch. It also means if your dog only needs one, we&apos;ll tell you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We&apos;ll add a third SKU when there&apos;s a category we can do meaningfully
                  better than what&apos;s already on the shelf — not before.
