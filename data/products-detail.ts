    'A daily soft chew built on three evidence-backed adaptogens — L-theanine, ashwagandha, and chamomile — that work with your dog\'s nervous system, not against it. No CBD, no melatonin, no sedatives. Vet-formulated. Third-party tested.',
  ingredients: [

  faqs: [
    { question: 'How is this different from CBD calming chews?', answer: 'CBD is a cannabinoid that acts on the endocannabinoid system — it\'s unregulated, dosing is inconsistent, and it can interact with medications. L-theanine and ashwagandha are amino acids and adaptogenic herbs with decades of safety data in dogs and humans. No regulation gray area, no drug interactions.' },
    { question: 'Will these make my dog sleepy?', answer: 'No. L-theanine promotes relaxed alertness — alpha-wave activity — not sedation. Ashwagandha lowers cortisol without inducing sleep. Your dog will be calmer but just as sharp.' },
    { question: 'How long until I see results?', answer: 'L-theanine peaks within 30–60 minutes for acute effects. Ashwagandha\'s cortisol-lowering effect builds over 2–4 weeks of daily use. Most owners report noticeable calm within the first week.' },
    { question: 'Can I give these before a vet visit or thunderstorm?', answer: 'Yes — give 30 minutes before a known trigger. The L-theanine component is fast-acting enough to be useful for acute events.' },
    { question: 'What\'s the 90-day guarantee?', answer: 'If your dog doesn\'t take to it, or you don\'t see results within 90 days, email help@pawbite.com and we\'ll refund your first order in full. Keep the chews.' },
