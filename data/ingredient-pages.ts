    category: 'probiotic',
    tldr: 'Bacillus coagulans is a spore-forming probiotic that survives stomach acid and reaches the dog gut intact, where it helps firm up stool and quiet mild digestive upset. The clinical strain GBI-30, 6086 is studied in both humans and dogs, with effective canine doses around 1 billion CFU for small dogs and 3-5 billion CFU for large breeds. It is one of the most shelf-stable probiotics, which is why it is a staple in dog supplements that sit on shelves and in warehouses.',
    whatItIs:
      'Bacillus coagulans is a beneficial bacterium that forms a protective spore around itself, similar to how a seed protects its embryo. Unlike most probiotics, which die when exposed to heat, moisture, or stomach acid, the spore form passes through the harsh upper gut and germinates in the intestine. It was originally classified as a Lactobacillus because it produces lactic acid, then reclassified once researchers understood its spore biology.',
    howItWorks:
      'Once the spore germinates in the small intestine, the bacteria produce lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids that lower gut pH and crowd out pathogens like E. coli and Clostridium. They also help train the gut immune system and support a more balanced microbiome over time. Because the spore is the delivery vehicle, this strain reaches the lower gut alive in a much higher percentage than typical lactic acid bacteria.',

    safetyNotes:
      'Bacillus coagulans has a long safety history in food and supplements and is generally recognized as safe. It is unlikely to cause more than transient gas during the first week of use. Dogs that are severely immunocompromised should only take any live probiotic after a vet check.',

        heading: 'Why the spore form matters',
        body: 'Most probiotic strains are fragile. They lose potency on a warehouse shelf, especially in summer heat, and many die in the stomach before reaching the gut. The spore form of Bacillus coagulans solves both problems. Kalman and colleagues showed that GBI-30, 6086 retains label-claim CFU counts at room temperature for two to three years, and survives gastric transit at a rate far higher than typical Lactobacillus strains. For a daily dog chew that ships and sits in a kitchen cabinet, that matters.',

        heading: 'What the canine evidence shows',
        body: 'A 2017 study in working dogs found that Bacillus coagulans supplementation improved stool quality scores during stressful events like travel and kenneling. Smaller case series and breeder reports describe firmer stool, fewer loose-stool days, and better recovery from antibiotic courses. The evidence base is smaller than human research, but the mechanism translates cleanly across species because the dog gut microbiome responds to the same lactic acid pathways.',
      },
      {
        heading: 'How it fits with other probiotics',
        body: 'Bacillus coagulans plays a different role than the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains in a multi-strain formula. It is a transient probiotic — it does not colonize the gut long-term, but it modulates the environment so that resident strains can flourish. Pairing it with a prebiotic like chicory inulin amplifies the effect because the short-chain fatty acids produced by the spore germination feed the broader microbial community.',

      'Ashwagandha is a shrub native to India and parts of the Middle East, used in Ayurvedic medicine for over 3,000 years. The root is the most-used part and contains active compounds called withanolides. As a supplement it is typically sold as a standardized extract, with the most-studied versions standardized to 1.5 to 5 percent withanolides. The name translates roughly to "smell of horse," referring to both the root smell and the traditional belief that it imparts equine vitality.',

      'Ashwagandha is classified as an adaptogen — a category of herbs believed to help the body resist stress and return to balance after disruption. Mechanistically, ashwagandha modulates the HPA axis (the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal hormonal cascade that drives the stress response), reduces cortisol levels in chronically stressed individuals, and supports GABA activity for a mild calming effect. Unlike L-theanine or chamomile, the effects build gradually with consistent daily use rather than producing an immediate change.',
