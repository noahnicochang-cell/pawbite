A probiotic helps rebuild the bench.\n\n**4. Food transitions cause GI upset.** A healthy gut can roll with a slow switch. A sensitive gut treats every change like a crisis.\n\n**5. Itchy skin or recurrent ear infections.** Roughly 70% of the immune system lives in the gut. Skin issues often track back upstream.\n\n**6. Bad breath that isn't dental.** If teeth are clean and breath still smells off, the source can be lower in the GI tract.\n\n**7. Excessive grass eating.** Some dogs just like grass. Others are self-medicating.\n\n**8. Constipation.** Less common than diarrhea but a real signal that motility and microbiome are out of sync.\n\n**9. Stress-related GI flare-ups.** Travel, boarding, thunderstorms, new houseguests. The gut-brain axis is loud.\n\n**10. Low appetite or picky eating that's new.** A change in eating habits with no other obvious cause is worth taking seriously.",

Slow, regular exercise.** Daily leash walks, swimming if available. Avoid weekend-warrior bursts of activity.\n\n**4.
