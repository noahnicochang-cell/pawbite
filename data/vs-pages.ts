PetLab uses a proprietary 8-strain blend without naming the strains — which is fine, but means you can't cross-reference the research yourself.

The formula works for most dogs — pork-flavored chews most dogs eat without complaint, prebiotic fiber blended in, and a CFU count that's actually in the clinically useful range (a lot of competitors come in at 1 billion or below, which is not enough to move the needle).\n\nPetLab also invests in customer service in a way most supplement brands don't — their support team is responsive, refunds tend to be processed without friction, and the brand has built real trust over the years. If you're new to dog probiotics and want a low-risk way to try one, PetLab is a reasonable place to start.\n\nWhere we'd push back: PetLab uses a proprietary blend, which is the supplement industry's way of saying we won't tell you exactly which strains are in here and at what ratio. That's a business decision (it protects the formula from copycats), but it also means a vet who wants to evaluate the supplement for a specific gut condition is working blind.",

Each one has decades of human and canine research behind it. You can google any of those names and find the trial data yourself.\n\nWe also include 200 mg of chicory inulin as the prebiotic (named amount, not vague), 250 mg of pumpkin powder for digestive support, and we test every batch with a third-party lab for CFU at expiration (not just at manufacture). The chews are duck-and-chicken liver based, made in the USA in a cGMP-certified facility, and we ship them in a recyclable canister.\n\nThe practical differences for your dog are small. The intellectual difference — knowing exactly what's going into them — is the part most owners we talk to care about once they look closely.",

PawBite is $32 retail, $26 on Subscribe & Save — a flat 20% off plus free shipping, no promo gymnastics required.\n\nThe Subscribe & Save discount also stacks if you add Hip + Joint via The Daily Duo bundle, dropping the combined per-month cost to $47.60 versus $70 retail — 32% off. PetLab sells joint chews too, but the bundle math depends on which retailer you buy from and which promo is live that week.\n\nNeither brand locks you in. You can skip, pause, or cancel a PawBite subscription from your account portal in one click — no calls, no fees.

We test for CFU at expiration because probiotics die over time, and a label claim of 5 billion CFU is meaningless if the actual count at month 9 is 200 million. The COAs are available on request and we're working on making them publicly downloadable on the product page.\n\nPetLab tests every batch as well, but the testing data is not published publicly — you'd need to contact support to get a COA.

The brand is stocked at Whole Foods, Target Premium Pet, and Chewy, which is meaningful retail real estate that very few DTC competitors have earned.\n\nThe product line is also broader than ours. Native Pet sells freeze-dried bone broths, mushroom immune blends, and seasonal allergy support powders in addition to the core probiotic and joint chews. If you want a single brand to cover supplements, toppers, and functional foods, they're a strong choice.\n\nThe whole-food angle has practical limits — you can't deliver 500 mg of glucosamine through whole-food ingredients alone, and Native Pet's joint chew uses 300 mg, which is on the lower end of what trial data supports.

Neither brand uses corn, soy, wheat, dairy, or artificial colors.\n\nWhere they diverge: PawBite is chew-only (no powders, no broths), direct-to-consumer only (no retail), and bundle-priced for owners who want the probiotic and joint products together (the Daily Duo).

The savings come from two places: PawBite's bundle stacks a 15% bundle discount on top of the 20% subscription discount (32% total), and our direct-only distribution means we're not pricing in retail margin to support Whole Foods and Target placement.\n\nIf you only need one category (just probiotic or just joint), the per-product pricing is closer to a wash — Native Pet's probiotic powder is ~$24 on subscription, PawBite Daily Probiotic is $26 on subscription.

They sell over 100 SKUs, they're carried at every major pet retailer in the US (Chewy, Amazon, Petco, PetSmart, Target, Costco), and the volume drives prices down meaningfully — a 90-count jar of Zesty Paws Probiotic Bites on Amazon Subscribe & Save during a promo cycle can land under $20.\n\nThe brand also has real third-party credentials. Zesty Paws is B-Corp certified — a meaningful signal about supply chain and labor practices that very few supplement brands have earned. They carry the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) Quality Seal on most SKUs, which requires annual facility audits, adverse event reporting, and ingredient-specific risk reviews. Both of those are credible signals that PawBite has not yet earned (NASC membership is in process for us).\n\nWhere the breadth has costs: across 100+ SKUs, formulation focus gets thin. Zesty Paws Probiotic Bites are 3 billion CFU per chew, which is in the working range but lower than what we use. The Mobility Bites use 250 mg of glucosamine and 200 mg of chondroitin, both at roughly half the dose of PawBite Hip + Joint. The brand makes those tradeoffs to hit the retail price points that mass-market distribution requires.",

Each strain has a citation in the product detail. Hip + Joint at 500 mg glucosamine and 400 mg chondroitin per serving, plus MSM, green-lipped mussel, turmeric, hyaluronic acid, and salmon oil. The Daily Duo bundle combines both at a 32% combined discount.\n\nWe don't sell calming chews, multivitamins, or skin-and-coat treats. If you need those, you'll need a second brand. The decision was deliberate: we'd rather do two products well than ten products at the dose point retailers want.\n\nDistribution is direct only. We're not on Amazon, Chewy, Petco, or Costco.

Zesty Paws Mobility Bites are around $22 a month, PawBite Hip + Joint is $30 on subscription. But on glucosamine-mg-per-dollar, PawBite is cheaper — 500 mg per serving at $30 is roughly $0.06 per 100 mg, versus Zesty Paws at 250 mg per serving for $22 (roughly $0.09 per 100 mg).\n\nIf you want lowest sticker price, Zesty Paws on Amazon wins. If you want lowest dose-adjusted price on the actives that matter for joint health, PawBite wins. The Daily Duo bundle at $47.60 per month is the configuration where PawBite is most defensible — it's a clinically-dosed probiotic plus a clinically-dosed joint chew at roughly Zesty-Paws-individual-SKU pricing.",

It's the most credible quality seal in the animal supplement industry. PawBite has an NASC membership application in progress; we expect to carry the seal by mid-2026.\n\nB-Corp certification covers governance, workers, community, environment, and customers.

Zesty Paws is one of the few US dog supplement brands to hold it. PawBite is not currently pursuing B-Corp; if that's an explicit deal-breaker for you, Zesty Paws is the better fit on that axis alone.\n\nOn batch testing both brands publish or provide third-party COAs covering CFU verification (where applicable), heavy metals, and microbial contamination panels.

Cosequin and its sister product Dasuquin have been studied in placebo-controlled trials in dogs with osteoarthritis (McCarthy et al. 2007; D'Altilio et al. 2007; and others), with results that show improvements in lameness, pain scores, and weight-bearing on force plate analysis. That body of evidence is genuinely rare in the supplement category.\n\nThe brand also has distribution through vet clinics and through Chewy/Amazon/PetSmart, which means continuity of supply is reliable and your vet can dispense it directly if that's the channel you prefer. If your vet has already recommended Cosequin, sticking with it is a defensible default — you're paying a brand premium, but you're paying it for a real evidence base.",

Green-lipped mussel at 150 mg, which delivers naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans and omega-3 fatty acids. Turmeric extract standardized to curcumin at 100 mg. Hyaluronic acid at 10 mg for joint fluid viscosity. Salmon-derived omega-3 (EPA + DHA) at 50 mg. All in one chew.\n\nTo match that profile with Cosequin, you'd typically stack Cosequin DS Plus MSM ($35–45/month) with a separate green-lipped mussel SKU or fish oil supplement ($10–20/month). Cosequin's Dasuquin Advanced line adds some of these ingredients but at higher price points (~$55–75/month for large dogs).\n\nThe honest tradeoff: PawBite does not yet have product-level clinical trial data. We can cite the trial data for the individual actives at the doses we use — those are published — but Cosequin can cite trials on the exact branded formulation, which we cannot.
