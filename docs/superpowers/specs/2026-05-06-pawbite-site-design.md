## 1. Project overview

### What this is
PawBite is a new DTC dog supplement brand launching with 2 SKUs (Daily Probiotic + Hip & Joint chews) plus a subscription bundle (The Daily Duo). The brand is positioned cute / fun / professional — charm on top, vet-formulated science under the hood.

### Goals
- Ship a complete brand site with full storefront, ~105-page content layer, quiz funnel, and customer portal
- Optimize for organic search **and AI-search citations** (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, AI Overviews)
- Mirror Trimi's SEO architecture (proven pattern across the operator's portfolio)
- Subscription-first revenue model with tiered S&S discounts

### Operator portfolio context
This site joins a portfolio that includes trytrimi.com (telehealth) and uses the same Next.js + Tailwind stack as sibling projects (ketcare, genesis).

### Domain status
pawbite.com is currently parked on atom.com. **Acquisition needed before launch** — flagged for ops.

### Competitive landscape (reference)
| Brand | Archetype | Posture |
|---|---|---|
| PetLab Co. | Mass-market clinical | Aggressive % off, vet endorsements, "100K+ reviews" |
| Native Pet | Premium-natural | Vet nutritionist, whole-food, Whole Foods/Target retail |
| Finn | Modern lifestyle DTC | Color-coded canisters, quiz, soft offers |
| Zesty Paws | Mass-market accessible | 100+ SKUs, NASC + B-Corp, mass retail |
| Honest Paws | Wellness/holistic | CBD-led, USDA Organic, "peer-reviewed" |

PawBite slots between Finn (visual) and Native Pet (substance), with Trimi-style SEO discipline.

---

## 2. Brand foundation

### Identity
- **Name:** PawBite (capital B)
- **Altitude:** Cute / fun / professional
- **Hybrid reference:** Finn (visual energy) + Native Pet (substance) + Trimi (SEO discipline)

### Positioning statement (internal only)
> PawBite makes the essentials your dog actually needs — vet-formulated, transparent, and made to be the easiest part of their day.

### Tagline hierarchy
- **Homepage hero:** "The good stuff your dog needs. Nothing weird."
- **Ads + IG:** "Big dog energy, in a little daily chew."
- **Recurring badge / footer:** "Vet-formulated • Dog-approved"

### Brand voice
Friendly, plainspoken, lightly funny. First-person founder voice ("I started PawBite because Theo's gut was a wreck…"). We say "your dog" — never "pup" or "fur baby." Headlines can wink; ingredient panels can't. Treat the reader like an intelligent adult who loves their dog. Science is woven in, not bolted on. We cite strains by name, explain the gut-skin axis in two sentences, and don't say "powerful" or "supercharged."

**Voice anti-patterns (banned phrases):**
- "fur baby," "fur parent," "pawsitively," "ruff," any verb-form-of-paw
- "powerful," "supercharged," "premium-grade," "advanced," "ultra," "complete"
- "trust your dog to" / "your dog deserves" — sentimentality-as-selling

**Banned punctuation:**
- Exclamation marks in body copy (allowed in CTAs and headlines only — use sparingly)

### Visual system

**Palette (locked):**
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Cream | `#F5EFE6` | Base/backgrounds, packaging fields |
| Forest | `#1F3A2E` | Wordmark, primary type, dark-mode bg |
| Terracotta | `#C8765B` | Primary CTAs (Add to Cart, Subscribe) |
| Warm yellow | `#E8B547` | Daily Probiotic accent, playful highlights, blobs |
| Pinky | `#F4B8A8` | Playful accent (illustrations, blobs, avatars) |
| Mint | `#B8D4C4` | Playful accent (Duo bundle band, secondary BG) |
| Off-white | `#FAFAFA` | Secondary backgrounds |
| Charcoal | `#2A2A2A` | Body text on cream |

**Typography (locked):**
| Family | Source | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Bagel Fat One | Google Fonts | Wordmark only (the PawBite logotype) |
| Fraunces | Google Fonts | Headlines. Use the SOFT axis (variation `'SOFT' 100`) for the round/bouncy feel. Italic variations welcome. |
| Inter | Google Fonts | Body text, UI labels |
| Caveat | Google Fonts | Handwritten accents — founder signature, eyebrows ("A note from our founder —"), illustration callouts |
| JetBrains Mono | Google Fonts | Numerical data (strain names, CFU counts, mg values), lot numbers |

**Illustration system:**
- All illustrations are **custom inline SVG**. No clip-art. No emojis. No icon libraries.
- A shared SVG icon/illustration library: mascot, mailbox, hearts, sparkles, stars, bones, paws, stethoscope, blobs, dashed callout arrows, squiggle dividers, leaf, shield-check, truck, USA factory, dog avatars (multiple personalities).
- The illustrated dog mascot is the brand's IP — used consistently across the site.

**Photography policy (the "one real photo" rule):**
Real photos are reserved almost exclusively for the **founder polaroid** above the fold. All other "dog imagery" across the site is custom illustration. This protects the brand's cute/illustrated feel from becoming muddy when AI-generated or generic stock dog photos creep in. Exception: real product macro shots (PDP imagery) once we have physical product — they earn their place as authentic.

**User reminder:** Surface this list explicitly before any execute-phase that would attempt to build them.

## 8. Trust signal slot system

All trust signals at launch are **aspirational** — we design slots in the UI that can be filled with real data as it lands without re-templating the site.

| Slot | At launch (placeholder) | Real data swap |
|---|---|---|
| Review count | "10,000+ 5-star reviews" (aspirational) | Real review count from Stamped/Okendo/Yotpo |
| Star rating | "4.9★ average" | Real aggregate |
| Vet name + bio + photo | "Dr. M. Hayes, DVM" (placeholder) | Real vet bio + headshot |
| Vet quote on PDP | Generic vet-quote placeholder | Real vet-formulated quote |
| Manufacturing badges | "cGMP-certified facility" (claim) | NASC seal, NSF, NSF-DRP if obtained |
| Press logos | (slot exists but empty at launch) | As earned — only real press, no fakes |
| "X dogs helped" stat | "10,000+ dogs" | Real shipment count |
| Founder name + photo | "Sam Whitlock" (placeholder) | Real founder identity |

Each slot is a component prop, not hard-coded copy. Replacement is a 1-line content change, not a UI rebuild.

## 9. SEO + AI-citation patterns

### The content template (applies to /learn/[slug], /concerns/[slug], /breeds/[slug], /ingredients/[slug], /vs/[competitor])

1. **H1** — target keyword, year-versioned where commercial intent (e.g., "best dog probiotic 2026")
2. **Byline row** — Author + DVM reviewer + last-updated date (visible)
3. **Definitive answer in first 2 sentences** — this is what AI quotes. Set apart visually (italic Fraunces, slightly larger). E.g.: "*Dogs benefit from probiotics when they have chronic loose stool, gas, post-antibiotic recovery needs, or food sensitivity. The most-studied strains for dogs are Bacillus coagulans, Bifidobacterium animalis, and Lactobacillus plantarum.*"
4. **Table of contents** with anchor links (sticky on desktop)
5. **Body content** with clear H2/H3 hierarchy (target keyword variations as H2s)
6. **≥1 comparison or data table** — AI loves to cite tables. Use mono font for numerical data.
7. **Cited sources** — named by author + year inline; reference list at bottom
8. **FAQ block** (5–8 Qs) — drives FAQPage schema
9. **Product recommendation** inline (1 of our 2 SKUs, contextually relevant)
10. **"Last reviewed by Dr. [Name], DVM on [date]"** — visible E-E-A-T signal

### Sitewide SEO + AI-citation moves
- **Year versioning** on commercial pages (best-X-2026, vs-Y-2026) — refresh annually
- **Definitive opening paragraphs** sitewide (homepage hero, About, every blog)
- **Author bylines with credentials** everywhere — DVM-reviewed articles get a "Reviewed by" line
- **Comparison tables** as a recurring content format
- **Internal linking** — every blog/concern/breed page links to ≥3 related pages and 1 product
- **External authority signals** — cite peer-reviewed studies by author + year + journal
- **llms.txt** at site root — clean Markdown index of high-priority pages for AI crawlers
- **AI crawler allow-list** in robots.txt — GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, etc., explicitly allowed
- **Structured data** on every page (Section 10)

## 10. Schema markup plan

| Page type | Schema | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sitewide | `Organization`, `WebSite`, `BreadcrumbList` | Site-level identity |
| PDP | `Product` + `Offer` + `AggregateRating` + `Review` | Rich-result eligible |
| Blog post (`/learn/[slug]`) | `Article` (or `BlogPosting`) + `FAQPage` (for the inline FAQ block) + `Person` (author + reviewer) | E-E-A-T signals |
| Concern + Breed pages | `Article` + `FAQPage` | Same template |
| Ingredient pages | `Article` + `DefinedTerm` (where applicable) + `FAQPage` | Glossary-style |
| Comparison pages | `Article` + `FAQPage` + comparison table marked with structured headings | Both products referenced via product cards |
| FAQ page | `FAQPage` | Site-level FAQ |
| Vet bio | `Person` + `MedicalOrganization` mention | E-E-A-T authority |
| About | `AboutPage` + `Organization` | Standard |
| Quiz | `WebApplication` (light) | Optional |

### Editorial policy file
`/editorial` page exposes our methodology: how ingredients are chosen, how articles are vet-reviewed, citation standards, conflict-of-interest disclosures, correction policy. This is a real E-E-A-T signal AI ranks high.

## 11. Quiz design

### 5-question flow (live at `/quiz`)

1. **"How much does your dog weigh?"** — 4 buckets: under 25, 25–50, 50–75, 75+ lbs
2. **"How old is your dog?"** — 4 buckets: under 1 yr, 1–7 yr, 7–10 yr, 10+ yr
3. **"What's the main thing you want to improve?"** — 5 options: gut/stool, hip & joint, skin & coat, anxiety, daily wellness
4. **"Anything else?"** (optional) — same 5 options, skip allowed
5. **"What does your dog eat now?"** — 4 options: kibble, fresh/raw, mixed, prescription diet

### Output (at `/quiz/results?id=...`)
- Recommended SKU(s) based on answers (rules-based mapping at v1):
  - gut/stool primary → Daily Probiotic
  - hip/joint primary → Hip + Joint
  - both primary or secondary → Daily Duo
  - skin/anxiety/wellness → Daily Probiotic (gut-first thesis) + roadmap note
- $5-off code on first order (gated by email capture)
- Personalized "Why this for your dog" explainer paragraph
- One-click "Subscribe to recommended" CTA

### Quiz copy tone
Warm, helpful, plainspoken. Caveat captions between questions ("Almost done —"). No clinical jargon. Frame as a friend who happens to know dog nutrition.

---

## 12. Commerce flow

### Subscription model
- **Subscribe & Save 20%** on every SKU
- **Bundle 15% discount** stacks with subscription (combined = 32% off retail when both)
- **Tiered subscription** (post-launch consideration, not v1):
  - 1 SKU subscription = 20% off
  - 2 SKU subscription = 25% off
  - 3 SKU subscription (when SKU #3 ships) = 30% off
- **Default delivery cadence:** every 30 days; customer can change to 45/60 in account portal
- **Skip / pause / cancel in 1 click** from `/account/subscriptions` — no phone calls, no cancellation fees (promised on /perks and /faq)

### Shipping
- Free shipping over $40
- Free shipping on all subscription orders
- $5 flat shipping under $40 (one-time orders only)
- US-only at launch

### Guarantee
- **90-day money-back guarantee** on first subscription order
- Return process: email-based at v1; self-serve portal post-launch

### Cart
- Slide-over panel (not full page)
- Free-ship progress bar at top
- "Frequently bought together" cross-sell (e.g., if cart has Daily Probiotic only → suggests Daily Duo upgrade with math callout)
- Subscription terms inline ("Ships every 30 days. Skip or cancel anytime.")

### Checkout
- **Native Shopify checkout** at launch (lowest friction, best conversion)
- Custom-styled to brand (colors, fonts) — no full headless checkout v1
- Apple Pay / Google Pay / Shop Pay enabled

### Customer portal (`/account`)
- Order history with reorder
- Subscription management:
  - Edit cadence
  - Swap SKU
  - Add/remove SKU
  - Skip next order
  - Pause subscription
  - Cancel (3-step flow with "Are you sure?" — no friction added, but offers a pause or swap as alternatives)
- Address book
- Saved payment methods
- Refer-a-friend (future)

## 13. Tech stack recommendation

### Stack (mirrors sibling DTC projects ketcare + genesis)
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ App Router + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui patterns (Radix primitives)
- **Commerce:** Shopify (Storefront API for catalog reads + native Shopify checkout for transactions)
- **Subscriptions:** Recharge or Skio (Shopify app — Recharge has bigger ecosystem; Skio has nicer customer portal UX)
- **CMS:** MDX (file-based) for blog posts + programmatic data (JSON or YAML) for breed/concern/ingredient pages
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Analytics:** Vercel Analytics + PostHog (product analytics + heatmaps) + GA4 (paid-ads attribution)
- **Email:** Klaviyo (DTC standard, deep Shopify integration)
- **SMS:** Klaviyo SMS (same platform; reduces vendor sprawl)
- **Reviews:** Stamped or Okendo (UGC photo support, Shopify-native)
- **Customer support:** Help Scout (email-based; affordable; scales)
- **Image hosting:** Cloudinary or Vercel's built-in image optimization
- **Domain + DNS:** Cloudflare (post-acquisition of pawbite.com)

### Why this stack
- Matches operator portfolio pattern → less context switching, faster iteration
- Next.js gives us full SEO control (every page server-rendered, schema markup in metadata, llms.txt easy to serve, AI-crawler-friendly)
- Shopify handles the regulated/boring stuff (tax, fulfillment, returns, recurring billing) — we don't reinvent that
- Vercel deploys per branch — design reviews are URL-based, not file-based
- PostHog gives us session replay + funnel analytics for the quiz funnel

### Rejected alternatives
- **Pure Shopify (Liquid theme):** less design freedom, weaker performance, harder to ship the programmatic SEO architecture
- **Shopify Hydrogen (full headless):** more engineering for marginal benefit over the Storefront API + native checkout hybrid
- **Next.js + Stripe (no Shopify):** would have to build inventory + tax + returns ourselves. Not worth it for a 2-SKU DTC brand.

### Repo structure (recommended)
```
/app                  Next.js App Router
  /(commerce)         Cart, checkout-related routes
  /(content)          Blog, learn, concerns, breeds, ingredients
  /(brand)            About, vets, science, reviews, perks
  /(legal)            Privacy, terms, etc.
  /products/[slug]    PDP
  /quiz               Quiz flow
  /account            Customer portal (gated by Shopify customer auth)
/components
  /ui                 shadcn-style primitives
  /brand              PawBite-specific components (canister mockup, illustrated mascot, callouts)
  /commerce           Product card, sub toggle, cart panel
  /content            Article layout, FAQ accordion, comparison table
/content              MDX files for blog + programmatic data sources
  /learn              MDX articles
  /breeds.json        Programmatic data
  /concerns.json
  /ingredients.json
/lib                  Shopify client, Klaviyo client, utils
/public               Static assets (icons, favicon)
/styles               globals.css + Tailwind config
/scripts              Build-time scripts (sitemap generation, llms.txt generation)
```

## 14. Imagery sourcing plan

### Categorical rules

| Asset type | Source at launch | Source post-launch |
|---|---|---|
| Founder polaroid (homepage hero) | Placeholder Unsplash | Real founder + dog photo (when identity finalized) |
| Product canisters (PDPs, homepage, cart) | CSS-rendered mockups | Real product macro photography (mandatory before paid ads) |
| Ingredient panels / back-of-label | Stylized mockups | Real macros once printed labels exist |
| Dog avatars (reviews, testimonials) | Custom inline SVG illustrations | Same — illustration is the brand standard |
| Blog header art | Custom SVG illustrations | Same |
| Lifestyle dog content (ads, IG) | UGC from real customers + creator partnerships | Same — never synthesize lifestyle "real dogs" |
| Vet headshots | Placeholder until real vets are on advisory board | Real headshots |
| Hero static (landing pages) | Custom SVG illustrations + the founder photo | Same |
| Email header art | Custom SVG illustrations | Same |

### Where AI image generation is allowed
- Packaging concept renders before real packaging exists
- Brand exploration / mood boards
- Pre-launch hero static
- Illustration accents and decorative shapes (then traced/recreated as inline SVG for brand consistency)

### Where AI image generation is explicitly NOT allowed
- Real PDP product macros (once product exists)
- Customer "before/after" photos (we use illustrated avatars + stat callouts)
- Vet headshots (real or none)
- Press/award assets
- Paid social ad creative for the lifestyle role (UGC only)

### Custom SVG illustration library (one of the biggest design assets)
The custom inline SVG library built into the Design 8 hybrid file is the foundation. It needs to be extracted into reusable React components in `/components/brand/illustrations/`. Components to extract:
- `<Mascot variant={"sitting"|"peeking"|"happy"|"sleepy"} color={...} />`
- `<DogAvatar variant={1..6} />`
- `<Mailbox />`
- `<Stethoscope />`
- `<Bone />`
- `<Paw />`
- `<Star variant={"hand-drawn"|"clean"} />`
- `<Sparkle />`
- `<Heart />`
- `<Shield />`
- `<Squiggle />`
- `<Blob variant={1..6} color={...} />`
- `<DashedArrow />`
- `<TapeAccent />`
- `<USFactoryBadge />`
- `<CalloutPill text={...} variant={"caveat"|"clean"} />`

## 15. Pre-launch checklist

Operations work that needs to happen alongside (not blocking) the build.

- [ ] **Acquire pawbite.com** (currently parked on atom.com — flagged)
- [ ] Register matching social handles (@pawbite on IG, TikTok, X)
- [ ] Stand up Shopify store + connect domain
- [ ] Choose + install subscription app (Recharge vs Skio)
- [ ] Stand up Klaviyo + connect to Shopify
- [ ] Real product photography session (once product is in hand)
- [ ] Real founder photo + bio
- [ ] Vet advisory board recruitment — 2–3 DVMs minimum
- [ ] cGMP certification verification (manufacturer)
- [ ] NASC seal application (if pursuing)
- [ ] FDA disclaimer copy — legal review
- [ ] Terms of service + privacy policy — lawyer review
- [ ] California Prop 65 review (dog supplements often need it)
- [ ] Set up help@pawbite.com + standard reply templates
- [ ] Set up Stamped/Okendo for reviews + outreach flow
- [ ] Set up Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster Tools
- [ ] Submit sitemap once live

---

## 16. Post-launch roadmap

### Wave 2 (0–90 days post-launch)
**Programmatic SEO long tail (~200 pages):**
- `/best-probiotic-for-[breed]` × 100 breeds
- `/best-joint-supplement-for-[breed]` × 100 breeds

**⚠️ User reminder:** confirm before building (will surface explicitly in writing-plans).

**Other Wave 2 work:**
- Email/SMS welcome series (Klaviyo flows)
- Abandoned cart flow
- Quiz follow-up sequence
- Subscription save flows
- First 50 real reviews → import to Stamped → swap aspirational social proof for real numbers

### Wave 3 (3–6 months)
- **SKU #3:** Calm chew (calming, anxiety) — highest-conversion-likelihood expansion based on category data
- Email/SMS retention sequences (replenishment reminders, education-led nurture)
- Affiliate / referral program
- Begin UGC creator partnerships for paid social

### Wave 4 (6–12 months)
- **SKU #4:** Multi or Skin (decision based on which organic keyword cluster is driving most traffic)
- Senior + Puppy variants of Daily
- Retail conversations (Whole Foods, Target, Petco)
- International (Canada first — same English-language SEO infrastructure)
- Vet practice B2B program
- Rescue org partnerships

## 17. Out of scope (explicit)

These are deliberately *not* in v1 — each has a reason.

| Item | Why not v1 |
|---|---|
| Multivitamin SKU | Zesty Paws + Finn own this. Adding it would dilute the gut/joint focus. |
| Dental SKU | PetLab owns the dental powder category. Need distinct positioning to enter. |
| CBD products | Honest Paws owns CBD. Regulatory complication. Tangential to gut/joint thesis. |
| Standalone fish oil | Commodity, low margin (40-50%). Already in Hip + Joint. Skip. |
| Cat SKUs | Different brand, different time. Zesty Paws does both and the brand suffers. |
| Forum / community | Moderation cost; low ROI in year 1. |
| Mobile app | DTC supplement brands don't need apps; web subscription portal is enough. |
| Raw food recipes | Adjacent content; dilutes the gut-first thesis. |
| Multiple language variants | US-English only v1. Canada in Wave 4. |
| Retail/wholesale pages | DTC-only at launch. |
| Influencer marketplace integration | Manual creator partnerships in Wave 3 instead. |
| Loyalty/points program | Subscribe & Save is the loyalty mechanism at v1. Points come post-launch. |

## 18. Open questions

These resolve during writing-plans or implementation kickoff. None block the spec.

1. **Tech stack confirmation** — Next.js + Shopify hybrid recommended (Section 13). Confirm before kickoff.
2. **Subscription app** — Recharge vs Skio. Skio has nicer customer portal but Recharge has bigger ecosystem. Default to **Skio** unless operator preference.
3. **Domain timing** — pawbite.com acquisition timeline. Build can proceed on a staging URL until domain lands.
4. **Real vet advisory board** — at launch, do we have a real DVM signed on or proceed fully with placeholders? Affects copy choice on PDP and About.
5. **Founder identity** — proceed with placeholder "Sam Whitlock" or substitute a real name? Placeholder works for v1 if needed; real swap is a 1-line content change.
6. **Reviews provider** — Stamped vs Okendo. Default to **Stamped** (cheaper at low volume, upgrade later).
7. **Help desk** — Help Scout vs Front. Default to **Help Scout** (cheaper, smaller team).
8. **Image optimization** — Cloudinary vs Vercel native. Default to **Vercel native** unless we hit limits.
9. **Quiz logic version** — Rules-based v1 (5 questions → if/else mapping). Personalization ML upgrade in Wave 3+.
